          p A collection of logos starting from September 2014 and continuously being updated with new projects.

            p.text-muted This logo followed the same process as the Lebanon MHA logo. A new major was started at Lebanon Valley College to attract more students.

            p.text-muted This project was designed during my Corporate Branding course in the fall semester of my senior year. I was given these project guidelines via pulling a slip out of a hat.
