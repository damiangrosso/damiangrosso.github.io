          p This project is very similar to the New Holland Country Store in which I designed a mobile user interface based off of the pre existing desktop experience. When given this project there were a few issues that needed to be addressed. The use of drop downs around the site was an idea that I conjured up as a way to reduce the kinematic load on the user while still having all the vital information on the site. This practice is best seen on the home and forms page.
